For first project, I did some research on the Olympics and chose the Rio 2016 Games and used Panda Library to provide users with functions to search a specific sport, country, or only see who won medals from a specific country

For my second project, we had to choose three different libraries to create three different programs. For my first program, I use pytube to create a youtube downloader. For my second program, I used PyGame to create a 2D breakout game which has been one of my favorites. For my third program, I chose Tkinter which provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications to create a clock which displays time in hours, minutes, seconds, and am/pm accordingly

For my third project, I picked out data from Kaggle to create a Credit Card Fraud Detection program. For this program, I used multiple libraries such as, numpy, sklearn, matlplotlib, and pandas etc.
